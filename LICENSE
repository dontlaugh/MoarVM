- You may "take" and re-use large portions of the source code at will.

- There is a "Standard Version" of this software to protect its name and

- "Downstream" package maintainers allow us to use their bug fixes/patches.

These are imported forks of external library projects.  Their source
redistribution licenses are for the most part as permissive or more permissive
than MoarVM's itself.  We have imported them here because we needed to make
extensive modifications to their capabilities or exposed API, and so couldn't
use system packages, or available system packages are too far out of date.

Note: you may find that libatomic_ops has some GPL-licensed files in the repo.
These are NOT included in any built binaries; they are merely tools for
configuring, building, and testing, and should be disregarded when considering
the redistributability of MoarVM in source form or binary form.
